# HighPrecisionLVDT
This project is created during Praktikum Raumfahrtelektronik - Lehrstuhl für Raumfahrttechnik at the Technische Universität München (TUM).
This board carries out submillimeter measurement of an actuator displacement, which is part of a test-setup to transport Regolith via hoppers.
As a sensing unit an LVDT is used, that is driven by a Signal Conditioner which gets read by a 24-bit ADC to a MCU where the Experiment data is then delivered via USB.

Without any additional filtering a 3 sigma precision of `0.000161 mm` was achieved.

The Python app gives easy access to the recording functionality while autodetecting the device Port, saving the downloaded lines in data.csv and direct plotting via pyplot.

However, the MCU can also be controlled directly via COM Terminal at `baudrate = 921600` with the following commands

| CMD |	HEX | FUNCTION | ANSWER | 
| :---:   | :---:   | :---   | :---   |
| '0' |	0x48 | start recording | `RECORDING\nEND` | 
| '1' |	0x49 | stop recording | `STOPPED\nEND` | 
| '2' |	0x50 | start download | <.csv file> `END-OF-FILE-SEQUENCE\n` | 
| '3' |	0x51 | enable stream | `Stream Data Enabled` < values > | 
| '4' |	0x52 | disable stream | `Stream Data Disabled`  | 

The stream mode is supporting a higher sample rate at 500 sps (instead 200 sps in recording).
We recommend to use the streaming mode via [SerialPlot v0.12](https://hackaday.io/project/5334-serialplot-realtime-plotting-software/log/192838-serialplot-v012-release) where baudrate = 921600, and Data Format = ASCII have to be set before sending a '3' as starting Command.

# LVDT Hardware Connection

The PCB has to be connected to the LVDT sensor and a computer to operate. The power and data transmission for the LVDT are

| PCB Label | LVDT Cable | FUNCTION | 
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| PYRD | Yellow - Red | Primary Coil | 
| PYBK | Yellow - Black | Primary Coil | 
| SBK | Black | Secondary Coil | 
| SRD | Red | Secondary Coil | 
| SBL | Blue | Secondary Coil |
| SGN | Green | Secondary Coil |

# Calibration

Since the linearity of the LVDT is proven in its factory test inspection and that linearity is conserved by the ADC a real calibration is not really meaningful.
Especially at this precision level, different kind of hardware than a digital Caliper is needed.

However, maximum positive and negative displacement of `± 1.27 mm` can be verified by its Voltage of `12.785418 mV` and `4362.785418 mV`.
If observed differently these mV values can be set in the MCU code.
The zero position of the sensor can be set through spinning the LVDT core on its positioning threaded screw.
